		<h2>6th Grade Learning</h2>
		<p> We learned how to type, use Microsoft Word, Exel, Slideshow, research, and Javascript.
			We learned about basic technology and nothing hard. 
			Most of us were new to technology so we started with the basics and started slow.

		<h2>8th Grade Learning</h2>
		<p> In 8th grade we learned how to code, filming, use storyboard, IMovie, and GarageBand. 
		Out of all the topics we have learned so far in 8th grade, I think that coding was the hardest because if you mess up, it wa frustrating and we had to go back to figure out what we did wrong.
