			The ATM program is a program where you learn about technology and ATM stands for applied technology magnet.<br>
			I think that the things that we had learned so far were at at first hard but after awhile you get the hang of it.<br>
			After awhile, you learn more about the topic then it get's easier.<br>
			Most of the projects we do are fun but are somtimes stressful.<br>
			When you make a mistake you have to go back and figure out what you did wrong.<br>
			At first I didn't think that I wasn't going to learn much in ATM but I ended up learning a lot.<br>
			ATM helped me understand technologly way much more than I used to know about it before.<br>
			I hope to learn much more in the rest of my time in ATM.<br>
